- investigate the 'water drop' thing with the tone drums
- make GUI (live pattern and parameter changes, play/stop, tempo control)
- debounce live parameter changes if performance is bad
- basic, static filters to shape drums
- make a soft-clipping saturator
- why are the first few beats after playback beings rushed?
- run play loop in a separate thread to the rest of the program (allow parameter tweaks, also listening for the stop event)
- experiment with simple per-drum reverb (i.e. diffuse multi-delay? Will this destroy performance?)
- refactor sample creation to use an object property 'parameters' (pitch, decay, etc.). This can be updated and the sample regenerated during playback
